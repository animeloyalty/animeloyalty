# AnimeLoyalty

Your personal anime collection on your device. Your content, your rules.

## What is AnimeLoyalty?

*AnimeLoyalty* is an anime download- and streaming application. You can stream anime directly from your favourite streaming services, or download anime to watch later. Downloaded anime is stored in the original video format (`h264` in a `mp4` container) and bundled with the subtitles in a `mkv` container. (**WARNING**: Downloading is not yet available in the desktop preview).
